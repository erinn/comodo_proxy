comodo_proxy is a simle(ish) proxy between Comodo's SOAP API and a custom and minimal REST API. comodo_proxy
is designed to be deployed in a Kerberos/GSSAPI environment as access control is handled that way. 

This code is meant to be run inside of a docker container, and for maximum ease I would recommend using the 
source-to-image tool: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image

Using s2i will dramatically speed up deployment of the application, if a container needs to be built by hand 
for some reason, that exercise will be left up to the reader.

From within the repository run the following for the CentOS image:
s2i build . docker.io/centos/python-36-centos7 comodo_proxy

Or if you have paid for a RHEL system:
s2i build . registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/python-36-rhel7 comodo_proxy

This will provide you with a docker container tagged 'comodo_proxy' which you will then need to start. The container 
requires the following mounts in order to work (all files must, obviously, be readable by the container):
- /etc/comodo_proxy/comodo_proxy.ini:/etc/comodo_proxy/comodo_proxy.ini:ro
The main configuration file whose options are detailed below.
- /etc/krb5.keytab:/etc/krb5.keytab:ro
The keytab to be used, another source location can be used if needed( for instance /etc/keytabs/krb5-HTTP.keytab) but 
/etc/krb5.keytab should be where it is mapped to in the container for ease.
- /etc/krb5.conf:/etc/krb5.conf:ro
The krb5.conf file to let kerberos kno how to operate
- /etc/pki/tls/certs/comodo_client.crt:/etc/pki/tls/certs/comodo_client.crt:ro
If two factor authentication is being used against Comodo's API, the location of the public client certificate.
- /etc/pki/tls/private/comodo_client.key:/etc/pki/tls/private/comodo_client.key:ro
If two factor authentication is being used against Comodo's API, the location of the private client key.
- /etc/comodo_proxy/acl:/etc/comodo_proxy/acl:ro
The ACL file, simply one principle per line, documented below.

All mounts are read only, as nothing should change on the host.

For ease of use during development, the docker-compose.yml file has been provided with all mounts listed.

## comodo_proxy.ini
The comodo_proxy.ini file contains most of the configuration directives for the application and is documented below:

    [default]
    # The URL of the Comodo API server
    api_url=https://hard.cert-manager.com/private/ws/EPKIManagerSSL?wsdl
    # The Comodo certificate type you wish to use
    cert_type_name=PlatinumSSL Certificate
    # The Comodo customer's login URI
    customer_login_uri=example
    # The Comodo user to log in as
    login=sis-unix-api
    # The Comodo organization ID to use
    org_id=
    # The Comodo password for the user
    password=
    # The password to set for revocation of Comodo certificates (does not appear to be used anywhere but 
    # Comodo requires it).
    revoke_password=
    # Comodo's secret key
    secret_key=
    # Whether to use two factor authentication with Comodo using a client certificate
    client_cert_auth=True
    # If using 2FA the location of the public certificate
    client_public_certificate=/etc/pki/tls/certs/comodo_client.crt
    # If using 2FA the location of the private certificate
    client_private_key=/etc/pki/tls/private/comodo_client.key
    # Because this is run in a container the hostname will not match the kerberos principle and as such needs to 
    # be overriden, set this to the kerberos principle's name.
    gssapi_hostname=api.example.com
    # You can select the GSSAPI service name to use here, if omitted HTTP will be used.
    gssapi_servicename=HTTP

# The comodo_proxy ACL file
The 'acl' file, located in /etc/comodo_proxy/acl in the container is simply formatted as one principle per line, for
example:

    api-user@EXAMPLE.COM
    api-user2@EXAMPLE.COM

The first part before the '@' is the user/host/service definition, the second is the Kerberos realm.
